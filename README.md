# 🧠 Low-Level Design (LLD) / Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Interview Prep

Welcome to the ultimate repository for mastering **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** — a must-have skill set for excelling in system design and software engineering interviews at top tech companies.

This repository aims to provide:
- 📚 Conceptual clarity on OOP principles and design patterns
- 🧩 Real-world system design problems with step-by-step solutions
- 🔁 Practice problems with clean, modular, and extensible code

---

## 🚀 Why LLD/OOD Matters

While high-level system design focuses on **architectural components and scalability**, low-level design digs into the **class-level and object-level interactions**, helping you:
- Write **modular**, **reusable**, and **maintainable** code
- Demonstrate **problem-solving skills** through clean abstractions
- Apply **design patterns** and **SOLID principles** in practice
- Ace LLD/OOD rounds that evaluate your understanding of real-world systems like Coffee Machines, BookMyShow, Elevator Systems, etc.

---

## 📘 Ideal For

- Aspiring software engineers targeting companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, Uber, etc.
- Anyone who wants to **master object-oriented problem-solving**.
- Developers looking to **refactor legacy codebases** using design principles.
